The loan, to assist in the financial strengthening and institutional restructuring of the public power utility, SONELGAZ, was part of the Bank's strategy to support Algeria's far-reaching program of public enterprise reform, to improve the efficiency and viability of these corporations. The project was designed to increase SONELGAZ' capacity to implement the major investments needed to meet increasing demand by optimizing energy production and improving the quality of supply. The longer-term goal was to use the reform of SONELGAZ as a model for the reform of the country's other public enterprises. The main objectives of the project were to: (a) restructure and strengthen the financial position of SONELGAZ, (b) gradually increase SONELGAZ' autonomy, (c) help implement major investments that would help optimize the productivity of the overall power system, (d) improve the quality of the power supply and (e) improve SONELGAZ's' management, planning and engineering capabilities."

The Project was the third cooperative effort by the Government of Algeria and the Bank to work in the agricultural sector and the first effort in the irrigation sub-sector. It was considered by the two parties as the preliminary phase for an anticipated wider Bank involvement in the irrigation sub-sector. Its objectives were to safeguard the continuation of irrigated agriculture in the Bas Cheliff district, to improve operation and maintenance of the existing systems, and to determine, through studies, the most viable follow-up irrigation development program in Bas Cheliff. At appraisal, the Project was intended to provide for rehabilitation of the irrigation head works by the replacement or repair of the head reach and main canal structures and the hydromechanical and electromechanical equipment, the purchase of operation and maintenance (O&M) equipment and the preparation of studies for follow-up irrigation development in Bas Cheliff."

The project will help to expand the EGA's power program by: 1) installing additional generating capacity; 2) constructing transmission and distribution facilities; and 3) making minor additions to the gas systems. Its components entail: 1) constructing thermal power stations. This will include improving older steam stations, completing two new stations in Oran and Bone, and constructing a gas turbine plant in Oran; 2) building hydroelectric plants; 3) constructing transmission and distribution facilities. This will include installing a number of transmission lines, substations, and additions to the distribution systems necessary to provide for expected development of the market; and 4) implementing a gas works program. These improvements will expand the power development program of the EGA in order to meet new load demands."

Some lessons learned included: The Bank's expectations on pricing policies were not achieved because of a fundamentally different Algerian Government perspective on the role of Societe Nationale de l'Electricite et du Gaz (SONELGAZ). Pricing has played no role in allocating resources for these programs and goals; and benefits, if any, are measured only at the far end of the production process. The institutional objective setting for public utilities projects financed by the Bank should be carried out with a more realistic appreciation of the political and social framework, especially in centrally planned economies where the concept of autonomous and financial viable utilities is not readily understood or accepted."

The proposed project will be the country’s first competitively selected private investment in power generation, first grid-scale renewable energy project, and first World Bank guarantee operation in Uzbekistan, with strong demonstration effects in Central Asia and beyond. The proposed Navoi Scaling Solar IPP Project supports the Government's policy objectives and reforms in the energy sector. These include expanding generation capacity through renewables, improving security of supply from domestic energy resources and promoting private sector participation to strengthen the energy sector sustainability, which is crucial for economic recovery and growth and job creation. Support under this WBG initiative is expected to accelerate the Uzbekistan energy sector development and improve its efficiency by deploying new business and financing schemes in the form of PPPs/IPPs. The Navoi Scaling Solar IPP will also support the Government’s commitments on climate change and its Nationally Determined Contribution implementation, particularly through the development of renewable energy and  avoidance of GHG emissions. The proposed project’s implementation and success will further accelerate the deployment of new renewable generation capacities, and hence the clean energy transition to stimulate economic recovery and development of appropriate infrastructure, when the COVID-19 crisis eases. The proposed project will involve the first-time deployment of an IFC financing in the energy sector and the IBRD’s risk mitigation product in Uzbekistan. The project will directly contribute to the Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) /Cascade Approach goals and bring additional climate co-benefits from the development of scalable clean energy investment program."

The CPS supports the government's medium-term strategy to continue the gradual transition to a more market-oriented economy, to ensure equitable distribution of growth between regions, and to improve the quality of infrastructure and social services. The CPS's two tier approach has proven to be effective. In the first tier, where government and Bank views broadly converge, support for increasing the efficiency of infrastructure and improving access to social services combines lending and advisory services. In the second tier, where government and Bank perspectives differ, support for the government's competitiveness and economic diversification agenda is focused on policy dialogue and technical assistance. IFC maintains its focus on private sector development through a combined investment and advisory approach. The government is making progress toward realizing the CPS milestones, with the strategic themes of the CPS remaining valid for the rest of the period."

          "cdata!": "This Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) reviews implementation to date of the FY08-11 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In support of Uzbekistan's 2007-10 Welfare Improvement Strategy (WIS), the CAS comprises four pillars: (a) enabling environment for shared growth; (b) increasing economic opportunities in rural areas; (c) improving service delivery; and (d) managing environmental and global goods provision. It proposed a flexible approach to both lending and analytical and advisory activities to allow for adjustment in light of client demands and the extent of agreement on policy issues during implementation. Uzbekistan's economy has been relatively unaffected by the global slowdown. This was due mainly to its cautious approach to participation in the world financial markets and tight state control over financial sector development; the effects of a large fiscal stimulus; and increased exports of key commodities. According to official data, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, after accelerating from 7 percent in 2005 to over 9 percent in 2008, slowed only slightly to 8.1 percent in 2009, in line with the government's target. Until the crisis, the economic growth was largely fueled by booming commodity prices and manufactured exports. Construction, trade and services sectors accounted for approximately 2/3 of real GDP growth in 2007-2009. In the aftermath of the crisis with external demand for manufactured goods having declined, the growth was supported by large investments financed by an anti-crisis fiscal stimulus and increased domestic consumption. Increased exports of key commodities contributed to sustain growth during the crisis. Specifically, surging global demand for gold and increased prices for natural gas and foodstuffs sustained total exports, offsetting lower demand for copper, cotton and chemicals. In 2009 overall, total exports grew by 2.4 percent, the trade surplus was US$2.3 billion, and the current account surplus was 6.4 percent of GDP, down from 12.8 percent in 2008."

          "cdata!": "Floating solar photovoltaic installations open new opportunities for scaling up solar generating capacity, especially in countries with high population density and competing uses for available land. Advantages of floating solar over land-based systems include higher energy yield, reduced evaporation, and improved water quality, among others. Combining floating solar with hydropower plants is of particular interest. Flexible hydropower output can be used to smooth the variability of the solar generation, while making better use of existing transmission assets, particularly beneficial in countries with weak grids. With a global estimated potential of 400 gigawatts, under conservative assumptions, floating solar could double the current global installed capacity of solar PV. Although the market is still nascent and challenges in deployment remain, the floating solar market is set to accelerate as the technologies mature. Floating Solar Market Report presents an overview of floating solar technologies, current deployment market and future opportunities, challenges related to floating solar deployment, policies and regulatory considerations, and current costs and project structuring. Floating Solar Market Report is the second publication of the series Where Sun Meets Water dedicated to floating and hydro-connected solar deployment."

There two components to the projects. The first component of the project is purchase of carbon emissions reductions. Certified emissions reduction (CFE) uses a long-term power planning simulation model (DECADES) to select future power plants that are needed for the expansion of the country's electricity system. On the basis of such modeling results it is possible to compare alternative scenarios of new generation plants and estimate emissions with- and without the wind power plants in the long term. During the operational period the actual dispatching of energy generated from the wind power plant is controlled by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE) and can be monitored in real time to record the amount of electricity produced from the plant and the equivalent avoided emissions for verification purposes. The second component of the project is wind energy power plant and interconnection line. Emissions reductions will be the result of CFE's wind energy project to be located in the ejido la Venta, municipality of Juchitan de Zaragoza, a region known as the Istmo de Tehuantepec, state of Oaxaca. CFE's wind energy project will use wind turbine generators that transform the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity."

The ejido land was established in 1951 with 5,815 hectares where each ejidatario was granted a maximum of 10 Ha. According to the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), the La Venta has a population of 1,814 people. The inhabitants of the ejido la Venta belong to the ethnic group Zapoteco, one of the largest ethnic groups of the State of Oaxaca. Although the ejido's population does not speak Zapoteco any more, they maintain the regional festive traditions and identify themselves as Zapotecos and Mexicans. More than half of ejidatarios (55 percent) in La Venta are employed in primary sector of the economy (agriculture, livestock, fishing), 12 perecent in the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction), and about 30 percent in the tertiary sector (services, commercial activities). In Ejido La Venta, zapoteco peasants have been traditionally been dedicated to agriculture, mainly sugar cane crop and other products for family consumption such as corn, beans and pumpkin. With the fall of sugar prices, sugar cane based agricultural activities are no longer the main economic activity; and has been replaced for cattle raising and agriculture of sorghum crop , watermelons, peanuts, melons, cucumbers and sesame which are sold in regional markets. Because of the strong winds, land is being cultivated only during the spring/summer cycle, and even in irrigated land the crop output is below the national performance average."

Other identified impacts include leaking and spills of hazardous chemicals and oils that may affect water and soil quality; loss of topsoil and vegetation; the use of vehicles and machinery that increase concentrations of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrous oxide, and other emissions; dust from material transport, vehicle movement, and excavation; noise from vehicles, machines, and equipment; and occupational accidents. Some measures to reduce or mitigate these impacts include replanting, restricting traffic and controlling speeds, avoiding work at night, avoiding disturbing the animal population and reducing use of farming areas, while paying compensation for land use, if needed; banning collecting or destroying forest plant species and animals; covering vehicles to suppress dust; promoting environmental awareness; planting along access roads; structuring turbines to dissuade birds and bats from flying in the vicinity, and monitoring bird deaths and collecting their carcasses; using plant waste to avoid soil erosion; using latrines; collecting household waste and disposing of it at authorized sites; prohibiting the use of fire or chemicals in clearing vegetation; replacing soil after the construction phase ends and replanting; and recycling waste where possible."

          "cdata!": "This environmental impact assessment for the Mexico Wind Umbrella (La Venta II) Carbon Finance Project, which generates electricity using wind energy and uses fossil fuel alternatives, discusses likely environmental impacts and proposes measures to mitigate them. The key environmental impact concerns the potential collision of birds (native and migratory) and bats with the blades of wind turbines during operation. Other identified impacts include leaking and spills of hazardous chemicals and oils that may affect water and soil quality; loss of topsoil and vegetation; the use of vehicles and machinery that increase concentrations of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrous oxide, and other emissions; dust from material transport, vehicle movement, and excavation; noise from vehicles, machines, and equipment; and occupational accidents. Some measures to reduce or mitigate these impacts include replanting, restricting traffic and controlling speeds, avoiding work at night, avoiding disturbing the animal population and reducing use of farming areas, while paying compensation for land use, if needed; banning collecting or destroying forest plant species and animals; covering vehicles to suppress dust; promoting environmental awareness; planting along access roads; structuring turbines to dissuade birds and bats from flying in the vicinity, and monitoring bird deaths and collecting their carcasses; using plant waste to avoid soil erosion; using latrines; collecting household waste and disposing of it at authorized sites; prohibiting the use of fire or chemicals in clearing vegetation; replacing soil after the construction phase ends and replanting; and recycling waste where possible."

In addition to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) portfolio review, the report reflects the Bank's collaboration with GEF to integrate global environmental concerns, into the regular Bank project and sector work. The report first illustrates key events, and developments, such as the Second GEF Council Meeting, and special news, to then examine highlights of the portfolio review on biodiversity, climate change, ozone protection, and international waters activities. It also covers the Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) report, with a sector review of operations, and outlook on upcoming OORG operations. Of special interest, is the participation and social assessment in Bank operations work, which incorporates the social dimension, as a significant component for the Bank's work in its project portfolio. The report provides a project matrix of GEF-Bank, and Montreal Protocol projects, and finally lists its environmental investment operations."
